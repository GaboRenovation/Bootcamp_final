## Reason why we selected this topic:

- This data model can be also aplicable to other markets being multi-purpose.

- Its versatility can also help us to apply concepts such as ETL (Extract, Transform and Loading), Data Engineering and Machine Learning.

## Questions we hope to answer with the data 

- Which territory manager is the most profitable? 
- Which territory is the most efficient (%)? 
- Shipping cost by region / country / market / city 
- Sales by Category 
- Sales by Sub-Category 
- Sales by Segment 
- % returns
- Forecast sales. Regression model based on % expected
- What category suffered the biggest change from one year to another?
- Positive and negative
- Try to explain why (hypothesis)

To be confirmed: 
New category introduction. Sales history weighted with similar products. For instanceÂ  "Tablets"
- TV's are similar in 35%
- Mobile phones are similar in 60%
- Using similarities and predict the demand of a new category or product
